                  <li><b>Resource Allocation:</b> Provides insights for law enforcement agencies to allocate resources efficiently based on areas with higher crime rates.</li>
                  <li><b>Community Safety:</b> Helps communities identify areas of concern and implement targeted crime prevention initiatives.</li>
                  <li><b>Evaluation of Interventions:</b> Enables the evaluation of existing crime prevention programs and interventions to determine their effectiveness.</li>
                  <li><b>Forecasting:</b> Provides a basis for forecasting future crime trends and adapting strategies accordingly.</li>

                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="static/images/fulls/crimerate/Slide3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                <p>The dashboard summarizes crime rates in Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba from 2020 to 2022. Overall, there were 3.32 million violations, primarily under the Criminal Code. Property crimes, notably theft, accounted for 55% of offenses, while Assault Level 1 was the most common violent crime. Ontario had the highest crime rate, followed by Quebec and Manitoba. Drug violations were prevalent under federal statutes. In 2022, Quebec's crime rate surged, surpassing Ontario. This highlights the need for targeted intervention, especially in addressing property crime prevention measures.</p>

                <p>The analysis examines crime rates in the top 5 cities of Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. Ontario leads with 57%, followed by Quebec at 30%, and Manitoba at 13%. Property crimes are the most common, comprising 53% of total violations. High-crime cities like Toronto, Montreal, and Winnipeg contribute significantly to these numbers.</p>

                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="static/images/fulls/crimerate/Slide5.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                <p>These charts depict adult and youth crime rates in high-crime cities across Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba. In Ontario, adults charged per 100k in the top 5 cities make up 63% of the total, with relatively steady rates from 2020 to 2022. Conversely, youth charges per 100k saw a notable decrease in 2021 followed by a subsequent increase. In Quebec, adults charged slightly outnumber youth in the top 5 cities, with both experiencing an increase from 2021, particularly a significant rise in youth charges in 2022. In Manitoba, adults contribute 60% of the average charges per 100k, with a decline in both adult and youth charges from 2020 to 2021 and a slight increase in 2022.</p>

                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="static/images/fulls/crimerate/Slide6.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                <p>The scatter plot demonstrates a direct correlation between adult and youth crime rates across the top 5 cities in each province. As adult crime rates rise, there's a corresponding increase in youth crime rates. This positive correlation is consistent across all provinces and years, highlighting the interconnected nature of adult and youth criminal activity. This insight emphasizes the need for comprehensive strategies in law enforcement and policy to address both aspects for effective community safety and crime prevention.</p>
